Auraxis Control Center
======================

This is the source code for the Auraxis Control Center

Currently all the features available on the app are available here. Due to time constrains I will not be able to work on this app for couple weeks so I decided that it was better to provide it to the community. 

The Plan
========

* Remove the paid version.
* Fix some FCs
* Fix the standart background not staying set.
* Add some toasts to provide feedback.
* Implement the correct use of fragments.
* Adding a link to http://www.reddit.com/r/Planetsidelore
